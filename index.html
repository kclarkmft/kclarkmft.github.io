								<h3>About My Practice</h3>

								<p>Life offers us many opportunities to grow. My clients experience points of transition in their lives and desire to have clarity when they are faced with challenges that include: grief and loss, complicated family dynamics, changes in their financial status, spiritual issues, unexpected medical conditions, and gender and identity issues. </p>

								<p>I work towards collaborating with my clients to create a sense of direction so their path in life and their personal goals are addressed. I have a strong emphasis on the principals of developmental psychology, and I enjoy working with children, adolescents, and families. </p>

								<p>I am passionate about healthy marriages and thriving relationships. I guide individuals toward healthy relationships by teaching them how to find, start, and maintain a quality partnership. I teach couples how to assertively ask for what they want and need from their partner and how to communicate effectively.</p>
										
								<p>Partnering with my clients to navigate the complexities of life and addressing obstacles is my primary goal.</p>
